#### Activity 0101:

"Find one example of a mobile app that has an interface that you consider 'good', and one example of a mobile app that has an interface that you consider 'poor' (or, if not poor, at least 'difficult'). Take some screenshots that highlight the best and worst of each app and provide a short description in your Process Portfolio justifying your choices."
